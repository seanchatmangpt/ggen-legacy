//! Pack installation logic for Phase 1

//! This module provides type definitions for pack installation.
//! The actual installer implementation is in `ggen-marketplace/src/install.rs`.

// NOTE: The real installer is in ggen-marketplace/src/install.rs with full
// cryptographic verification, caching, and pack extraction support.
// This module only provides type definitions for compatibility.
