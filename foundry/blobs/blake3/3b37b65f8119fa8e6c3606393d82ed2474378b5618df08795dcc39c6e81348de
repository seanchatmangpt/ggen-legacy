#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::needless_raw_string_hashes)]
//! μ⁻¹ inverse-pipeline coverage tests for the Rust AST extractor.
//!
//! These are Chicago-TDD tests: they use real filesystem collaborators
//! (`tempfile::TempDir` + real `.rs` source files written to disk), drive the
//! real extraction + RDF conversion code path, and assert on the observable
//! output (the emitted Turtle and the number of recovered triples). There are
//! NO mocks, stubs, or behavior-verification doubles.
//!
//! Goal: prove that the extended extractor recovers materially more of an A
//! (artifact / source) than the historical struct-only extractor, so that the
//! A→O recovery underpinning the post-Chatman A≅O claim is meaningful.
//!
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//! KNOWN COMPILE PREREQUISITE (UNVERIFIED in this environment):
//!
//! The `reverse_sync` module is present on disk under
//! `crates/ggen-core/src/reverse_sync/` and re-exports its public API via
//! `reverse_sync/mod.rs`, BUT it is not currently declared with
//! `pub mod reverse_sync;` in `crates/ggen-core/src/lib.rs`. Until that module
//! is wired into the crate root, the `ggen_core::reverse_sync::...` path used
//! below will not resolve and this test will fail to compile. Wiring `lib.rs`
//! is outside this change's file-ownership scope; this is flagged as the
//! primary deferred compile risk for the reviewer.
//! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
